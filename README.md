####  Restaurant Reviews App

Welcome to my Restaurant Reviews Repo. This Project is part of Udacitys Front End Nanodegree Program.
It is designed to have a wide accessibility, even for visually or hearing impaired users. 
The focus was to make it responsive, with offline-first in mind. 

## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future-proofing JavaScript code.
